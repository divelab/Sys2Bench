    "Q: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\nA: There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, so there are 10 * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers.\n Because there are 10 yellow flowers, so there are 10 + 18 = 28 yellow and purple flowers.\n There are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so there are 28 * 0.25 = 7 green flowers.\nIn summary, he has 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 flowers in his garden.

    "Q: Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nA: Tina makes $18.00 an hour, so she makes 18 * 8 = $144.00 in an 8-hour shift.\nTina works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she works 10 * 5 = 50 hours.\nSince she works 8 hours every day, she gets 50 - 8 * 5 = 10 hours of overtime.\nHer hourly overtime wage is 18 + 18 / 2 = $27.00.\nTina works 10 hours a day, and 8 hours of that is paid at her regular hourly wage, so she makes 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime every day.\nSince her hourly overtime wage is $27.00, she makes 27 * 2 = $54.00 in overtime each day.\nEvery day, tina makes $144.00 in an 8-hour shift and $54.00 in overtime, so she makes 144 + 54 = $198.00 each day.\nTina works 5 days a week, so she makes 198 * 5 = $990.00.\nThe answer is 990.\n\n"
