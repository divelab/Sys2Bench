This is impossible as you can't be in two places at once. \n\n* **Direct Flight Limitations:** Even if the time constraints for meeting friends and relatives were flexible, there are no direct flights between Paris and Stockholm according to the provided list. This means you'd need an extra day for travel between these cities, making the 15-day limit even tighter.\n\n**To find a solution, you'll need to adjust your constraints.
