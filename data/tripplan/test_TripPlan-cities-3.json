Here's why:\n\n1. **Starting in Berlin:** The conference forces us to be in Berlin on days 1 and 4.\n2. **Dubrovnik Trip:** To spend 3 days in Dubrovnik, we'd need at least two flights (to and from).\n3. **Flight Limitations:**  We can't fly directly from Berlin to Dubrovnik.

This leaves no time for general sightseeing in Tallinn before the workshop.\n* **Direct Flights:**  The direct flight requirement means you must fly from Dublin to Tallinn. To reach Dublin, you must first fly from Madrid.\n\n**The problem:**  There's no way to fit in 4 days in Madrid, 3 days in Dublin, and travel time while still arriving in Tallinn by day 6. \n\n**To make this trip possible, you would need to:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Tallinn visit:** Either shorten the desired time in Tallinn or move the workshop dates.\n2. **Consider indirect flights:**  Allowing for a connecting flight could provide more flexibility in the schedule. \n",
