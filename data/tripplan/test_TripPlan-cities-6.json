These events overlap, making it impossible to fulfill both obligations with direct flights. \n* **Paris Conference:** You have a conference in Paris on days 13-14, right after the Vilnius show. This means you'd need a direct flight from Vilnius to Paris, which isn't available according to the provided flight information.\n\n**Therefore, it's impossible to create a trip plan that meets all the given constraints using only direct flights.**\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Trip Duration:** Extending the trip by a few days could allow for travel time between conflicting events.\n2. **Consider Indirect Flights:**  Allowing for connecting flights would open up more possibilities for travel between cities.\n3. **Re-evaluate Constraints:**  Determine if any of the time constraints for workshops, shows, or conferences are flexible. Could any dates be shifted?\n4. **Prioritize:** If some events are more important than others, focus on creating a plan that prioritizes those, even if it means missing other events.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these solutions.

        "pred_5shot_pro": "This task presents a challenge. Let's break down why a direct flight solution is impossible and then offer an alternative:\n\n**Why it's impossible with direct flights:**\n\n* **London Constraint:** You MUST be in London from days 3-7 to meet your friend.\n* **Munich Constraint:** You MUST be in Munich on day 7 and 8 to visit relatives.\n* **Direct Flight Conflict:** There are NO direct flights between London and Munich. To travel between these cities, you'd need a connecting flight, breaking the direct flight rule.\n\n**A Possible Solution (with one connecting flight):**\n\nSince a direct-only solution is impossible, here's the most efficient plan allowing for one connecting flight:\n\n**Day 1-2:** Arrive in Stuttgart, attend the conference.\n**Day 2:** Fly from Stuttgart to London.\n**Day 3-7:** Visit London, meet your friend.\n**Day 7:** Fly from London to Munich (this will likely require a connecting flight).\n**Day 7-8:** Visit Munich, see your relatives.\n**Day 8:** Fly from Munich to Oslo.\n**Day 8-9:** Visit Oslo.\n**Day 9:** Fly from Oslo to Krakow.\n**Day 9-10:** Visit Krakow.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* This plan prioritizes the fixed time constraints in London and Munich.\n* The connecting flight on Day 7 is unavoidable to meet both obligations.\n* The remaining cities are fit in around these core commitments.\n\n**Important Note:**  When planning real trips, always check for direct flight availability and be prepared to adjust your itinerary if necessary.

It's impossible to create a 12-day itinerary with ONLY direct flights that meets all the given constraints. \n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Re-evaluate Constraints:**  Is there flexibility in the Nice meeting or the Istanbul arrival date? Even a slight adjustment could open up possibilities.\n2. **Consider Connecting Flights:**  While the task specifies direct flights, a single connecting flight might be the only solution.\n3. **Alternative Transportation:**  Could a train or other ground transportation link Nice and Istanbul within the timeframe?\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these solutions or adjust the constraints!

But, you also need to be in Helsinki on day 4. Direct flights between Seville and Split are not available.\n\n**Conclusion:**  It's impossible to fulfill all the given constraints with the available direct flights. You would need to either:\n\n1. **Adjust the trip dates:**  Could the wedding, relative visit, or workshop dates be slightly flexible?\n2. **Consider indirect flights:**  Are you open to flights with layovers to make the itinerary work? \n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore either of these options! I'm happy to help find a solution if we can adjust the constraints. \n",

        "pred_5shot_pro": "This task presents a challenge. Let's break down why and see if we can find a workable solution:\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Overlapping Time Constraints:** You have events in Warsaw (Day 1-2) and London (Day 2-3) which are impossible to attend both with direct flights.\n* **Limited Direct Flights:**  While there are many direct flight options, the specific time constraints make it difficult to create a route that satisfies all of them.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust Time Constraints:** The most practical solution is to see if any of the time constraints for the events can be adjusted slightly.  Could the workshop in Warsaw be attended on Day 2 only, or could the wedding in London be attended on Day 3 only? Even a small adjustment could open up possibilities.\n\n2. **Consider Indirect Flights:** If adjusting the time constraints isn't possible, you might need to consider a single indirect flight to make the itinerary work. For example, you could fly from Warsaw to a city with a connecting flight to London to attend the wedding.\n\n**Let's assume we can adjust the London wedding to Day 3 only.** Here's a possible itinerary:\n\n**Day 1-2:** Arriving in Warsaw and attend the workshop.\n**Day 2:** Fly from Warsaw to London.\n**Day 3:** Attend the wedding in London.\n**Day 3:** Fly from London to Nice.\n**Day 3-4:** Visit Nice.\n**Day 4:** Fly from Nice to Amsterdam.\n**Day 4-5:** Visit Amsterdam and meet your friend.\n**Day 5:** Fly from Amsterdam to Riga.\n**Day 5-9:** Visit Riga.\n**Day 9:** Fly from Riga to Brussels.\n**Day 9-13:** Visit Brussels.\n\n**Important Note:** This solution relies on the assumption that the London wedding can be attended on Day 3 only. If this isn't possible, you'll need to explore indirect flight options or further adjust the itinerary. \n",

        "pred_5shot_pro": "This task presents a challenge. Let's break down why and explore possible solutions:\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n* **Conflicting Time Constraints:** You need to be in London for the show on days 5-6, but also in Vienna for a conference on days 6-8. This is impossible with direct flights as you can't be in two places at once.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Itinerary:**\n\n   * **Option A:**  Could you shift the London visit to days 3-4? This would allow you to attend the Vienna conference.\n   * **Option B:**  Is it possible to attend only one day of the Vienna conference? This would free up a day for travel.\n   * **Option C:**  Can the Berlin visit be shortened or moved? This might create flexibility.\n\n2. **Consider Indirect Flights:**\n\n   * If adjusting the itinerary isn't possible, you'll need to consider a flight with a layover to get from London to Vienna in time for the conference.\n\n**Let's assume Option A (shifting the London visit) is possible. Here's a potential itinerary:**\n\n**Day 1-4:** Arriving in Hamburg and visit Hamburg for 5 days.\n**Day 4:** Fly from Hamburg to London.\n**Day 4-5:** Visit London for 2 days and attend the show.\n**Day 5:** Fly from London to Vienna.\n**Day 5-8:** Visit Vienna for 3 days and attend the conference.\n**Day 8:** Fly from Vienna to Nice.\n**Day 8-12:** Visit Nice for 5 days.\n**Day 12:** Fly from Nice to Berlin.\n**Day 12-14:** Visit Berlin for 3 days and meet friends.\n**Day 14:** Fly from Berlin to Salzburg.\n**Day 14-15:** Visit Salzburg for 2 days.\n\n**Important Note:** This solution relies on the flexibility to change the London visit. If that's not possible, you'll need to explore the other options mentioned above. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Valencia Conference:** You need to be in Valencia between days 3 and 7.\n* **Valencia Flights:** The only way to get to Valencia is by direct flight from Istanbul or Rome.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. **Starting in Istanbul:**  Even if you arrive in Istanbul on Day 1 and immediately fly to Valencia on Day 1, you can only stay in Valencia until Day 5 (to satisfy the 3-7 day requirement). This doesn't leave enough time to visit all the other cities.\n\n2. **Starting in Rome:**  You can't fly directly from Rome to Valencia. You would need to go through Istanbul, which again creates the same time constraint as above.\n\n**Conclusion:**  The flight connections and the fixed conference dates in Valencia make it impossible to create a 17-day itinerary that includes all 6 cities. \n",
