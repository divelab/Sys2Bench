There's no direct flight path that allows attending the wedding in Athens and the workshop in Dublin while also meeting the friend in Berlin within the given time constraints. Here's why:\n\n* **Wedding in Athens (Day 13-15):**  To be in Athens for the wedding, you'd need to arrive by Day 13.\n* **Workshop in Dublin (Day 15-19):** This immediately follows the Athens wedding, requiring a flight on Day 15.\n* **Friend in Berlin (Day 7-11):** To meet the friend, you must be in Berlin before Day 11.\n\nThe issue is that traveling from Athens to Dublin (for the workshop) after meeting the friend in Berlin would make you miss the start of the wedding in Athens. There's no combination of direct flights that can bridge this gap.\n\n**To solve this, you'd need to consider one of the following:**\n\n1. **Adjust the dates:**  Could the friend in Berlin be met slightly earlier or later? Could the workshop or wedding dates be flexible?\n2. **Consider indirect flights:**  Allowing one connecting flight might open up possibilities.\n3. **Prioritize:**  Which event is most important? You might need to choose between the wedding, the workshop, or meeting the friend. \n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these options, and I can help you create a revised itinerary! \n",

These overlap and cannot be met simultaneously.\n* **Limited Direct Flights:**  The direct flight options make it difficult to jump between these cities with such tight schedules.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust Constraints:** The most practical solution is to re-evaluate your constraints. Could you:\n    * Shift the dates of your workshop in Riga?\n    * Adjust the timeframe for meeting friends in Venice?\n    * Consider attending the annual show in London on a different day?\n\n2. **Indirect Flights:** If adjusting constraints isn't possible, you'll need to consider indirect flights. This will add travel time and complexity to your itinerary.\n\n**Let's assume you can adjust the Venice meeting to days 13-15.

The only direct flight to Dubrovnik is from Zurich.\n* **Zurich Constraint:** You need to be in Zurich for a wedding between days 12 and 16. This means you must fly from Zurich to Dubrovnik on day 16.\n* **Istanbul Constraint:** You want to be in Istanbul between days 9 and 11.\n\n**The Problem:**  There's no way to be in Istanbul (days 9-11), then in Zurich (days 12-16), and then fly to Dubrovnik on day 16. Direct flights don't allow for this sequence.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Dubrovnik Visit:**  Consider shifting the Dubrovnik visit to earlier in the trip, allowing for a flight from Istanbul to Zurich, then time in Zurich before flying to Dubrovnik.\n2. **Adjust the Istanbul Visit:**  If the Istanbul dates are flexible, move them to after the Zurich wedding. This would allow a flight from Zurich to Dubrovnik, then onward to Istanbul.\n3. **Consider Indirect Flights:** If direct flights are not absolutely essential, you could explore options with connecting flights to make the desired itinerary work.\n\n**Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these solutions by adjusting the constraints.
