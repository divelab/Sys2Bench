Let's break it down:\n\n* **Combining smaller slots:**  Notice there are several 30-minute gaps scattered throughout the day. Unfortunately, no two consecutive 30-minute gaps align perfectly for everyone.\n\n**Conclusion:**  It's impossible to schedule a 1-hour meeting on Monday with these constraints. You'll need to:\n\n1. **Consider a different day:**  Check everyone's availability on another day of the week.\n2. **Shorten the meeting:** If possible, reduce the meeting time to 30 minutes. \n3. **Ask someone to reschedule:**  Politely inquire if anyone with a conflicting 30-minute meeting could potentially reschedule it. \n",
